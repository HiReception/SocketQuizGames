				<h2>What is Trivle?</h2>
				<p>Trivle is the board game for the internet age. No cards, no wires, not even an app to download! The only thing you need to play is a phone, or any other device with access to the Internet. It's easy to get a game up and running, and even easier to join!<br/><br/>
				At the moment, Trivle is still very much a prototype. It's open source, and currently <a href="https://github.com/HiReception/SocketQuizGames">listed on GitHub</a>.

				<h2>Hosting a Game</h2>
				<h3>Every good quiz needs a charismatic host... but I guess you'll do in a pinch.</h3>
				<p>When you arrive at the Trivle homepage, click "Start a Game", and pick one of the options available. You'll immediately be taken to the Host Console, where you'll be able to see everything that takes place in the game. As soon as this console loads, you'll see a four-letter code in the top-right hand of the screen. This is the code that will allow players to join your game on their own devices. When they do, you'll see their name appear in the list of players immediately.</p>

				<h2>Playing a Game</h2>
				<h3>You can't have a game show without contestants - late-night call-in shows notwithstanding.</h3>
				<p>Click "Join a Game" on the Trivle home page, and type in the four-letter code for your game (the host will be able to give this out, assuming they actually <em>want</em> you to be playing and aren't deliberately excluding you), and a "Screen Name" by which the host will see you playing. This could be your first name, a nickname, a table number - the only condition is that it has to be unique among players in that game.<br/><br/>
				Once you're in, any time you're involved in the game (e.g. when a buzz-in round starts, or you need to write down an answer), the information you need will appear on your device screen.</p>

				<h2>Displaying a Game (Optional)</h2>
				<h3>Because sometimes, the host can't be trusted to get the scores right.</h3>
				<p>Along with having a host and players, you can also set up a dedicated "Display" session for a game. This will essentially act as a public display of the host console - the full state of the game will be visible to all, but not anything sensitive to the playing of the game (such as correct answers to questions).<br/><br/>
				<em>Note: Due to current technical limitations, a Display user is required to be active to play the Wheel of Fortune game.</em></p>
